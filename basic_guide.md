# Scalar Exhibition Template Guide

The _Scalar Exhibition Template_ comes with two brand new page layouts for Scalar: the **scrolling path**, and the **people** layout. To see the template in action, visit our [test site](http://aliciapeaker.digital.brynmawr.edu/scalar2/set-dev/index). 

This guide presupposes some basic familiarity with [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/). If you're new to Scalar, you can learn more about the scholary digital publishing platform [here](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/). Links within the guide below take you to further instructions from Scalar's [user's guide](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/index).

## Installing on hosted Scalar

### Getting started with Scalar
1. In your web browser, navigate to the [Scalar Exhibition Template](http://aliciapeaker.digital.brynmawr.edu/scalar2/set-dev/index).
1. Select 'Register,' and follow the instructions to sign up for an account.
1. Select 'Dashboard' in the top right to navigate to your dashboard.


### Getting started with the Scalar Exhibition Template
1. From your Scalar dashboard, select the tab "My Account."
1. Scroll down to "Create new book" and select "Scalar Exhibition Template" from the drop-down list.
1. Give your book a title, confirm you're not a robot, and hit "Create."
1. To replace the full-width images, [edit each page](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/editing-pages?path=working-with-content) and change the [key image](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/styling-a-page) to any uploaded media file.
1. To add or delete sections from the front page, select the pencil edit icon, scroll down to the "Relationships" tab and add, delete, or move any pages you would like to this path. *Note: At this time, the* Scalar Exhibition Template *will only work with Scalar pages (not media).*
1. You can create additional scrolling path pages by [creating a new page](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstart-creating-a-page?path=quickstarts) and selecting "Scrolling Path (custom layout)" under the layout tab. Then add the pages that the path contains under the "Relationships" tab.

### Adding a People Page
1. To display your own people on the scrolling path, upload individual media files for each person associated with the project. On the upload page, write their names in the title field and their short bios in the description field. 
1. Create a new page.
1. Add each person to the page as an [inline media file](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstart-adding-inline-media-to-a-page?path=quickstarts). Leave all of the defaults (size: small, align: left) except **caption**, which you should change to "Title and Description."
1. Under the **Layout** tab, select "People (custom layout)." 
1. If you want your folks to appear on your scrolling path page, make sure your the page has been added to your scrolling path page.
